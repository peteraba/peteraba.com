            Peter has been hacking in PHP and JavaScript for over 12 years, but recently started experimenting
            with a much wider variety of programming languages like Python, Hack and especially Go.<br>

            Peter is an avid learner and he likes to share his findings on this blog. Expect to see only technical 
            posts here, mostly on webprogramming.
