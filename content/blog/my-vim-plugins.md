My cheat sheet for my vim bundles.

<!--more-->

sensible.vim
------------

A universal set of defaults that (hopefully) everyone can agree on.

 - If you're new to Vim, you can install this as a starting point, rather than copying some random vimrc you found.
 - If you're pair programming and you can't agree on whose vimrc to use, this can be your neutral territory.
 - If you're administrating a server with an account that's not exclusively yours, you can scp this up to make things a bit more tolerable.
 - If you're troubleshooting a plugin and need to rule out interference from your vimrc, having this installed will ensure you still have some basic amenities.
