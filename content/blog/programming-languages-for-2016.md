So I love learning new languages, especially ones that computers understand. Learning German is a bit less fun for me personally.

Anyway, I thought I'd write a quick list of languages I want to consider for learning for 2016. I'd be happy to be able to craft a couple of hundreds of lines of code in the following languages.

 # [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (2010)
 # [elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) (2012)
 # [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) (2012)
 # [OPA](http://opalang.org/) (2011)
 # [julia](http://julialang.org/) (2012)
 # [flow](http://flowtype.org/) (2014)
 # [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) (2014)
 # [oden](http://oden-lang.org) (2015)
 # [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) (2014)
 # [Ceylon](http://ceylon-lang.org/) (2011)
 # [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/) (2011)

Realisticly speaking, I think I'll manage to test drive 4 or 5 of these and get really familiar with 1 or 2. Just for comparison, in 2015 I only managed to really deepen my knowledge about Bash.

Of course this post will only become relevant in 2017, but hey, it's March already!
