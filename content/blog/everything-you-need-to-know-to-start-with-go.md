There is an [awesome list of Go tools](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go) out there to find pretty much everything Go. The problem is, it's a huge list, really not ideal for beginners in my humble opinion. Therefore I try to put together a Golang essentials below. Expect it to be regularly updated as I find old projects to no longer be supported and new ones which should really make this list...

## Missing features / Future of Go

People coming from other languages often look for their favorite features from their previous languages. Oftentimes
these are there in Go in some other form or name, sometimes they are missing because the language authors consider them
harmful and sometimes they just haven't been added yet. Chances are, the community already discusses these features and
the Go team is collecting these complaints and discussions to consider them when designing Go 2.0. You can find the list
on [Github](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/ExperienceReports).
