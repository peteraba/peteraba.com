This post was first published on my [blog](https://peteraba.com/3-recent-posts-on-tech-management-i-loved).

Have you ever read a blog post so great, that you thought everyone should read it? I sure have, more than once, but I found that in most cases "everyone" just didn't care. So I thought I'll try something I haven't tried before and cherry pick a few posts by topic from the recent years and share them as a single blog post. I'll throw in some of my own comments and act like I've actually done something creative today.

1. The article that pushed me to create this post was ["The 3 Capacities of a Good Manager"](https://medium.com/better-programming/the-3-capacities-of-a-good-manager-a950e798aaaa). It not only details 3 ways how really bright engineers can end up as less than great managers, it also explains how to identify each one by symptoms, describes how managers need to think about their roles and gives a simple framework for managers to assess themselves. To some extent I felt like I was reading an excellent excerpt of a book, but somehow it felt complete at the same time. [Matthew Werner](https://medium.com/@ropstenrich) did a great job here, I'll re-read this post multiple times for sure.

2. As someone who's been a technical manager before, but who's been an IC again for the last two years, I really appreciated ["The Engineer/Manager Pendulum"](https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/) by [mipsytipsy](https://charity.wtf/author/mipsytipsy/). In her post she argues that tech managers do their jobs best before being removed from tech for 2 to 3 years.
I think she's mostly right. I mean you may consider yourself a technical manager as CTO of a company and you may do a great job, but chances are, you won't be doing a lot of tech at that point and it could even be that any random manager with extensive management experience could do your job just as well. Often the only difference is that you still have some "street-cred" from your techies, because you know what a recursive function is. If you're really dealing with tech however, you probably need to get your hands dirty from time to time even if it's for something less than exciting.

3. Finally, I really liked the piece titled ["I hate manager READMEs"](https://medium.com/@skamille/i-hate-manager-readmes-20a0dd9a70d0), in which [Camille Fournier](https://medium.com/@skamille) argues that manager READMEs might be well-intended, but they scream `"I'm the boss here"` and often they sound like their authors are making weak excuses for their own foibles, quirks, and challenges, or even they even suggest their readers that they're at blame if they don't know how to "handle" said managers properly.
Truth is, I also liked ["12 “Manager READMEs” from Silicon Valley’s Top Tech Companies"](https://hackernoon.com/12-manager-readmes-from-silicon-valleys-top-tech-companies-26588a660afe) by [Brennan McEachran](https://hackernoon.com/@i_am_brennan) earlier, but I enjoyed the insight to how these people think and I never thought it would be great have my manager's publish these.

Okay, so that's 3 posts, therefore we're done. But since I can't really stop there, I'll add 3 more very briefly:

1. I just found out today that as for everything in tech, there's an **awesome** ["awesome list" for management](https://github.com/LappleApple/awesome-leading-and-managing) too. I'm especially stoked about the [Meetings and Time Management](https://github.com/LappleApple/awesome-leading-and-managing/blob/master/Meetings-and-Time-Management.md) page, which is a topic I definitely want to learn more about.

2. [Switching from Engineering to Management](https://dev.to/bndr/switching-from-engineering-to-management-56hf) is a good read for people who need to decide whether to make a career shift to management or not.

3. A while back I wrote about [the dangers of detached management](https://peteraba.com/blog/the-danger-of-detached-management/), which might be a nice addition to the first post, "The 3 Capacities of a Good Manager", but you know, I'm biased.
