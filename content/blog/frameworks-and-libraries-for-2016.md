My first post of the year was about programming languages I'm interested in learning, but there are so many other technologies on the waiting list, that it deserves another post I think. Just to make the review in 2017 that much sweeter or funnier.

Frontend:
 - [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
 - [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/)

JavaScript:
 - [Angular 2](https://angular.io/)
 - [Auerlia](http://aurelia.io/)
 - [Vue](http://vuejs.org/)
 - [Angular UI](http://angular-ui.github.io/)
 - [AG Grid](https://www.ag-grid.com/)
 - [Griddle](https://github.com/GriddleGriddle/Griddle)

PHP:
 - [PPI](http://www.ppi.io/)
 - [Zend Expressive](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive)
 - [Puli](http://docs.puli.io/en/latest/)

Go:
 - [go-torch](https://github.com/uber/go-torch)
 
Environment:
 - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
 - [rkt](https://github.com/coreos/rkt)

And just to make a fair comparison for the time it will be due, in 2015 I really only learned 3 technologies:
 - [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)
 - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
 - [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) (Not from scratch)
